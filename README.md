# Risk-Analytics-in-Banking-Financial-Services

## Author

## Project Overview  
This case study focuses on risk analytics in the banking and financial services industry. The primary goal is to identify patterns that indicate whether a client may face difficulties in paying their loan installments. This knowledge can help institutions make informed decisions, such as:  
- Denying or approving loans.  
- Adjusting loan amounts.  
- Lending to risky applicants at higher interest rates.  

By ensuring that consumers capable of repaying loans are not rejected, banks can optimize their portfolio and risk assessment processes.  

## Objectives  
1. Understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default.  
2. Identify variables that are strong indicators of default through exploratory data analysis (EDA).  

## Key Steps  
### Step 1: Initial EDA  
- Explore the `application_data` and `previous_application` datasets.  
- Concatenate the two datasets to analyze them together.  

### Step 2: Combined Analysis  
- Perform detailed EDA on the combined dataset to identify important features for predicting defaulters.  

## Approach  
- Libraries used:  
  ```python  
  import numpy as np  
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
  import pandas as pd  
  import seaborn as sns  
  import warnings  
  warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")  
# Exploratory steps include:
Loading data from application_data.csv and previous_application.csv.
Leveraging additional information from columns_description.csv to understand variable meanings.
Applying EDA techniques such as summary statistics, correlation analysis, and feature importance visualization.
# Dataset Information
application_data.csv: Contains information about clients applying for loans.
previous_application.csv: Contains details about previous loan applications by clients.
columns_description.csv: Provides metadata about the variables in the datasets.
# Notes:
The file encoding may vary, so we handle potential encoding issues (ISO-8859-1 or utf-8).
Tools and Techniques
Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Warnings.
# EDA Techniques:
Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Feature engineering.
Data visualization.
